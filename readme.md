# Love the office?

## Update 23-03-20
### The back-end hosted at cyclic has been canceled as the have made changes to their free plan to only host 1 app for free, previous it was 3 apps. So I've made the decision so temporarly take down the back-end of this app.

A simple page that fetches famous (?) quotes from the hit tv-show 'the office'. Please have some patience while trying it out as the backend is hosted on a free tier service, that isn't were fast. But it works! 👍🏼

## Backend

[You can check out the repo for the backend here ](https://github.com/nilssoncjonas/office-api-backend), the quotes is stored in an MySQL database and an API running Node.js server will handle the GET requests from the front-end.
